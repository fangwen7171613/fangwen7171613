🛠 SDP Project:
SDP is a testament to a seamless software development experience, providing a comprehensive suite for building high-performance applications. It includes a range of tools from a high-throughput MQ capable of over a million TPS, to a feature-rich blockchain framework. SDP encapsulates essential components for modern software development, including a high-performance watchdog, an IoT chain framework, and more.

**Note:** Some SDP modules are undergoing extensive updates to match the platform's evolution. Community contributions are welcome!
